| Term | Definition | Base Structure / Syntax | Real Life Example | App Example |
|------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
|      | A named container used to store a value that may change. | `var x = 5;` |  |  |
|      | A fixed value that cannot change once set. | `const PI = 3.14;` |  |  |
|      | The kind of value a variable holds, like numbers or text. | `int`, `String`, `bool` |  |  |  

|      | A sequence of characters used to represent words or text. | `"Hello World"` |  |  |

|      | Whole number values. | `int age = 16;` |  |  |

|      | Number values with decimals. | `double age = 16.2;` |  |  |

|      | A value that can be true or false. | `bool isLoggedIn = false;` |  |  |

|      | A collection of values in a specific order. | `List<String> names = [];` |  |  |

|      | A special value that means “nothing.” | `String? name = null;` |  |  |

|      | A reusable block of code that performs an action. | `void sayHi() { print("Hi"); }` |  |  |

|      | The information passed into a function to change how it works. | `greet(String name)` |  |  |

|      | The result a function gives back. | `return total;` |  |  |

|      | Where a variable or function can be used. | (No set syntax — concept-based) |  |  |

|      | Blueprint for creating objects with specific structure and behavior. | `class Dog {}` |  |  |

|      | A specific version of a class. | `Dog myDog = Dog();` |  |  |

|      | A variable that belongs to a class/object. | `String name;` |  |  |

|      | A function that belongs to a class. | `void bark() {}` |  |  |

|      | A special function used to set up a class when it’s created. | `Dog(this.name);` |  |  |

|      | Hiding the inner workings of code so users only interact with what they need. | (Concept — not specific code) |  |  |

|      | Changing how a built-in or inherited function behaves. | `@override` |  |  |

|      | A function that does not return a value. | `void printMessage() {}` |  |  |
